# LED-Strip-Controller

With the LED Strip Controller you can easily make your LED Strip colorfull !

You can choose to make it react to your music, your screen (ambilight), choose your own color or having a global ambilight.

To create this software I follow this tutorial http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Ambilight-Using-Arduino-Nano/ and instead of using Bambilight I'm using Adrilight https://github.com/fabsenet/adrilight/releases 

# Required

Hardware :
- Arduino
- LED strip
- power source for LED

Software :
- Arduino IDE
- FastLED library
- Edit Adrilight.ino acordingly to your setup
- LED Strip Controller.exe
